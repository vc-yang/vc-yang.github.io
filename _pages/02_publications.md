My paper on urban scaling laws is currently under review at _Nature Human Behavior_, and my project on the polarization of political parties is in preparation for publication. Hopefully, they will appear here soon. 

Prior to joining Northwestern as a PhD student, I built mathematical models applied to heat transfer and microwave chemistry as an undergraduate. The following are some of this work published in peer-reviewed journals. 

* B.S. Tilley, **V.C. Yang**, J.C. Baiense, S. Evans (2017) ‘Frequency-dependent thermal resistance of vertical U-tube geothermal heat exchangers’, _Journal of Engineering Mathematics_, 1-20.

* E.M. Moon, **C. Yang**, and V.V. Yakovlev (2015) 'Microwave-induced temperature felds in cylindrical samples of graphite powder -- experimental and modeling studies', _International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_, vol. 87, No 8, pp. 359-368.

* **C. Yang** and V.V. Yakovlev (2013) 'An efficient empirical model for microwave-induced average temperature of liquid cylindrical reactants', _Journal of Microwave Power and Electromagnetic Energy_, 47 (3), pp. 177-185.


As an undergraduate student, I also conducted experimental social psychology research, studying the effect of foreign accents on hiring decisions. My result shows a double standard on how men and women are perceived for having a foreign accent. This work did not end up published in a journal, but I think it's fun. You can find my project report [here](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-043012-143024/unrestricted/Accent_Study_Final_Report.pdf).
