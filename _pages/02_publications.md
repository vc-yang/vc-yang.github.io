My paper my project on the polarization of political parties is in preparation for publication. Hopefully, they will appear here soon. 

My work on modeling large scale human behavior: 

* **V.C. Yang** , A.V. Papachristos, D.M. Abrams, 'The origin of urban productivity scaling laws: mathematical model and new empirical evidence,' under review. [[Pre-print]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00476).

* L. Lee, S. Zhang, **V.C. Yang** , 'Do two parties represent the US? Clustering analysis of US public ideology survey,' under review. [[Pre-print]](arxiv.org/abs/1710.09347). 

Prior to joining Northwestern as a PhD student, I built mathematical models applied to heat transfer and microwave chemistry. The following are some of this work published in peer-reviewed journals. 

* B.S. Tilley, **V.C. Yang**, J.C. Baiense, S. Evans (2017) ‘Frequency-dependent thermal resistance of vertical U-tube geothermal heat exchangers’, _Journal of Engineering Mathematics_, 1-20.

* E.M. Moon, **C. Yang**, and V.V. Yakovlev (2015) 'Microwave-induced temperature felds in cylindrical samples of graphite powder -- experimental and modeling studies', _International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_, vol. 87, No 8, pp. 359-368.

As an undergraduate student, I also conducted research in social psychology. I conducted human-subject experiments to study the effect of foreign accents on hiring decisions. My result shows a double standard on how men and women are perceived for having a foreign accent.
