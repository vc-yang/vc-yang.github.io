**Urban scaling**

**Politics and elections**

I designed and supervised an undergraduate research project to investigate whether adding more political parties in the US would help represent the public's ideology better.

* L Lee, S Zhang, **VC Yang** (2019) 'Do two parties represent the US? Clustering analysis of US public ideology survey,' _SIAM Undergraduate Research Online_. [[PDF]](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01651.pdf?ver=2019-07-01-152228-507). 

My manuscript on the polarization of political parties is in undergoing review and revision. Hopefully, it will appear here soon. 

**Math applied to engineering problems**

Prior to joining Northwestern as a PhD student, I built mathematical models to solve engineering problems. The following are some of this work published in peer-reviewed journals. 

* BS Tilley, **VC Yang**, JC Baiense, S Evans (2017) 'Frequency-dependent thermal resistance of vertical U-tube geothermal heat exchangers', _Journal of Engineering Mathematics_, 1-20.

* EM Moon, **C Yang**, and VV Yakovlev (2015) 'Microwave-induced temperature fields in cylindrical samples of graphite powder -- experimental and modeling studies', _International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_, vol. 87, No 8, pp. 359-368.

* **C Yang** and VV Yakovlev (2013) 'An efficient empirical model for microwave-induced average temperature of liquid cylindrical reactants', _Journal of Microwave Power and Electromagnetic Energy_, 47 (3), pp. 177-185.

**Social psychology**

As an undergraduate student, I also conducted research in social psychology. I performed human-subject experiments to study the effect of foreign accents on hiring decisions. My result shows a double standard on how men and women are perceived for having a foreign accent.

Effect of foreign accent and gender on employment decisions and negotiations', Interactive Qualifying Project Report, Worcester Polytechnic Insitute.
