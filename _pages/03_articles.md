### Collective intelligence as infrastructure for reducing broad existential risks

I write an [opineion piece on Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nD3zzdS4XNzvv94XX/collective-intelligence-as-infrastructure-for-reducing-broad). 

The leading discussion in existential risk and effective altruism centers on investigating each risk separately, such as misaligned AI and nuclear war. While the outcomes of many risk situations hinge on the performance of human groups---whether a collective (examples include democratic governments and scientific communities) can work together and generate good outcomes. This issue is often referred to as coordination problems in the existential risk and effective altruism communities. Here, I first argue that it is too narrow to think about these rich and encompassing phenomena as one of coordination. I then propose to think about them as Collective Intelligence problems, one of processing distributed information effectively. Collective Intelligence is a transdisciplinary field that studies how a collective of individuals performs together to achieve goals in a broad sense. The applications cross-cut humans (tribes, corporations, cities, etc.), animal groups, robotic swarms, and collections of neurons. I give an overview of this field and highlight findings relevant to improving the collective intelligence of human groups. Finally, existential risk and effective altruism communities can benefit from learning from other transdisciplinary disciplines and put a greater effort into identifying commonalities across various risk domains to help improve the robustness of our society in the face of many potential risks.
