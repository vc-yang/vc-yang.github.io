Published Dec 2016.

I created this flowchart as a summary of the typical mathematical modeling process that I go through, as part of a talk for undergraduate mathematics students. You can find a high quality pdf file [here](/files/Model_flowchart/math_model_flowchart.pdf). 

You are welcome to share and use it, please credit this page when you do so.
