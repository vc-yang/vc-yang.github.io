I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. I work on mathematical models applied to social systems. Some topics of my work include crime in cities and dynamics of political elections. The methods I use are often a combination of differential equations, numerical simulations, and learning from data. Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked on mathematical models applied to heat transfer and microwave chemistry.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I co-founded and is the president of [NuTango](http://nutango.wix.com/nutango), Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I am also the president of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics's Northwestern Chapter.
