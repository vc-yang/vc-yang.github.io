I am a Peters Scholar and Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. My research uses mathematical tools to understand complex phenomena in human society. Some topics of my work include crimes in cities and the polarization of political parties. My approach is to build mechanistic models from first principles and to confront them with real-world data. I work closely with social scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I was the founding president of NuTango, Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I was also the 2016-17 president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Northwestern Chapter.

### Media 
* I gave a talk at the [Seven Minutes of Science Symposium](http://rsg.northwestern.edu/w2017.html) about urban scaling laws and the "reasoning from first principles" approach. [[Talk Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5ewFzNSYI)
* Northwestern News Network featured my research on urban scaling laws. [[Interview Video]](https://youtu.be/eIiNyI5sWuk?t=18m49s)
* Northwestern University's Data Science Videos featured my work in [[Video 1]](https://youtu.be/9lh6TYon0_I). In [[Video 2]](https://youtu.be/5by2WzQVx9U), I shared my view on two types of data science.


### News 
  * Aug 2020: New paper, [Why are U.S. parties so polarized? A "satisficing" dynamical model](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/ref/10.1137/19M1254246), appears in *SIAM Review*. We develop a model for the public's voting behavior following satisficing decision making, and explain the disconnect between the predominantly moderate policy positions of the U.S. public and the polarization of political parties. [[Press release]](https://santafe.edu/news-center/news/new-model-shows-how-voting-behavior-can-drive-political-parties-apart)  
* July 2020: Present at IC2S2, about my work on modeling the formation of social categories. 
* June 2020: Present at ACM Collective Intelligence conference, about my new opinion dynamics model for the effect of uninformed individuals on collective decisions. [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94zotD8b7eU&feature=youtu.be)
* April 2020: New article, [Misinformation about an outbreak like Covid-19 is important public health data](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/07/misinformation-outbreak-is-important-public-health-data/), appears in *STAT News*. We discuss how gathering data on misinformation and human behavior in general, can be important for curbing the COVID-19 outbreak. 
* Feb 2020: New paper, [The interpretation of urban scaling analysis in time](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0846) appears in *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*. We develop a theoretical framework to unify cross-sectional and temporal approaches in urban scaling. [[Press release]](https://santafe.edu/news-center/news/rosetta-stone-urban-scaling-makes-sense-how-cities-change-across-time-and-space) [[Preprint PDF]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459540)
* Nov 2019: New preprint, [Falling through the cracks: A dynamical model for the formation of in-groups and out-groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10419), appears on arXiv. We develop a dynamical systems model to predict boundaries of social categories, and how middle of the spectrum fall through the cracks of categorization. 
* Sept 2019: New paper, [Modeling the origin of urban-output scaling laws](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032306), appears in *Physical Review E*, explaining why different types of crime scale differently with city size, and what these differences tell us about the origin of urban scaling laws. [[Press release]](https://santafe.edu/news-center/news/study-bigger-cities-boost-social-crimes) [[PDF]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335851907_Modeling_the_origin_of_urban-output_scaling_laws)
* July 2019: New paper, [Do two parties represent the US? Clustering analysis of US public ideology](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01651.pdf?ver=2019-07-01-152228-507), appears in *SIAM Undergraduate Research Online*. The paper is lead by my undergraduate mentee, Louisa Lee, and answers if adding more political parties in the US would help represent the public's ideology better. 
* July 2019: Lecture in the SFI Complexity Summer School, about applications of simple dynamical systems models in social problems.
