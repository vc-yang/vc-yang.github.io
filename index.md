I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University. In my research, I use mathematical tools to uncover the simplicity behind complex phenomena of human society. Some topics of my work include urban productivity scaling laws and dynamics of political elections. My approach is to build simple, mechanistic models starting with indisputable concepts from physics (e.g. conservation laws); and aided by firmly-established social science findings (e.g. the Strength of Weak Ties). In addition to valuing rigor, I want my theories to be testable by real-world observations. So, I build with practicality in mind and gather data (e.g. city crime rates and Congress voting records) to validate my theories. I work closely with social scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. If you are interested in a collaboration, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I was the founding president of [NuTango](http://nutango.wix.com/nutango), Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I was also the 2016-17 president of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Northwestern Chapter.
