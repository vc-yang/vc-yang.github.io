I am an Omidyar Fellow and Peters Hurst Scholar at the Santa Fe Institute. My research uses mathematical tools to understand complex phenomena in human society. Some topics of my work include crimes in cities and the polarization of political parties. My approach combines mechanistic models built from first principles and learning from real-world data. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University. Outside of academics, I enjoy dance and Aikido.

### Media 
* I discussed my work on political polarization and social categories on the [Complexity Podcast](https://complexity.simplecast.com/episodes/43)
* My "satisficing" voting model was featured in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinanderton/2020/10/27/this-is-the-reason-american-politics-are-so-polarized-infographic/?sh=266cce84187b), and in [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-social-media-is-so-good-at-polarizing-us-11603105204) as part of a larger piece about sociophysics, polarization, and media manipulation.
* I interviewed with KSFR Santa Fe Public Radio about my recent model for political party polarization. [[Audio]](https://www.ksfr.org/post/sfi-led-study-asks-political-divisiveness-or-political-games)
* I gave a talk at the [Seven Minutes of Science Symposium](http://rsg.northwestern.edu/w2017.html) about urban scaling laws and the "reasoning from first principles" approach. [[Talk Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5ewFzNSYI)
* Northwestern News Network featured my research on urban scaling laws. [[Interview Video]](https://youtu.be/eIiNyI5sWuk?t=18m49s)
* Northwestern University's Data Science Videos featured my work in [[Video 1]](https://youtu.be/9lh6TYon0_I). In [[Video 2]](https://youtu.be/5by2WzQVx9U), I shared my view on two types of data science.


### News 
* April 2021: New preprint, [When do social learners affect collective performance negatively? The predictions of a dynamical-system model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00770) appears on arXiv. We develop a general mathematical framework to model how the interaction of complex social and cognitive factors manifests in collective decision outcomes. Our model predicts a critical threshold of social learners (those who follow others instead of evaluating merit of the options on their own), above which the system destabilizes, and either option can prevail regardless of merit.  
* Mar 2021: New paper, [Falling through the cracks: Modeling the formation of social category boundaries](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247562) appears on PLOS ONE. We predict boundaries between us and them on a continuum attribute using a dynamical system model. We find middle of the spectrum fall through the cracks of categorization, and validate with data on political independents. 
* Mar 2021: New preprint, [Scaling of Urban Income Inequality in the United States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13150) appears on arXiv. With students of the Undergraduate Complexity Research program, we analyze income distributions of hundreds of US cities. We show that income in the least wealthy 10% scales close to linearly with city population, while income in the most wealthy decile scale with a significantly superlinear exponent. Our results suggest the benefits of larger cities are increasingly unequally distributed with city size. 
 * Aug 2020: New paper, [Why are US parties so polarized? A "satisficing" dynamical model](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/ref/10.1137/19M1254246), appears in *SIAM Review*. We develop a model for the public's voting behavior following satisficing decision making, and explain the disconnect between the predominantly moderate policy positions of the US public and the polarization of political parties.

* July 2020: Present at IC2S2, about my work on modeling the formation of social categories.  [[Video]](https://youtu.be/j5qGxYQu-dQ)
* June 2020: Present at ACM Collective Intelligence conference, about my new opinion dynamics model for the effect of uninformed individuals on collective decisions. [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94zotD8b7eU&feature=youtu.be)
* April 2020: New article, [Misinformation about an outbreak like Covid-19 is important public health data](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/07/misinformation-outbreak-is-important-public-health-data/), appears in *STAT News*. We discuss how gathering data on misinformation and human behavior in general, can be important for curbing the COVID-19 outbreak. 
* Feb 2020: New paper, [The interpretation of urban scaling analysis in time](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0846) appears in *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*. We develop a theoretical framework to unify cross-sectional and temporal approaches in urban scaling. [[Press release]](https://santafe.edu/news-center/news/rosetta-stone-urban-scaling-makes-sense-how-cities-change-across-time-and-space) [[Preprint PDF]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459540)
* Sept 2019: New paper, [Modeling the origin of urban-output scaling laws](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032306), appears in *Physical Review E*. We develop a new theory for urban scaling that can explain the different scaling exponents, and find support in data. We find the variations in exponents a feature of urban scaling, not a bug.

* July 2019: New paper, [Do two parties represent the US? Clustering analysis of US public ideology](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01651.pdf?ver=2019-07-01-152228-507), appears in *SIAM Undergraduate Research Online*. The paper is lead by my undergraduate mentee, Louisa Lee, and answers if adding more political parties in the US would help represent the public's ideology better. 
* July 2019: Lecture in the SFI Complexity Summer School, about applications of simple dynamical systems models in social problems.
