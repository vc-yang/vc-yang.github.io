I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University. I use mathematical tools to uncover the simplicity behind complex phenomena of human society. Some topics of my work include crimes in cities and polarization of political parties. My approach is to build mechanistic models from first principles and to confront them with real-world data. I work closely with social scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. In fall 2018, I will join the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu) as an Omidyar Fellow.

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I was the founding president of [NuTango](http://nutango.wix.com/nutango), Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I was also the 2016-17 president of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Northwestern Chapter.

### Media 
* I gave a talk at the [Seven Minutes of Science Symposium](http://rsg.northwestern.edu/w2017.html) about urban scaling laws and the "reasoning from first principles" approach. [[Talk Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5ewFzNSYI)
* Northwestern News Network featured my research on urban scaling laws. [[Interview Video]](https://youtu.be/eIiNyI5sWuk?t=18m49s)
* Northwestern University's Data Science Videos featured my work in [[Video 1]](https://youtu.be/9lh6TYon0_I). In [[Video 2]](https://youtu.be/5by2WzQVx9U), I shared my view on two types of data science.
