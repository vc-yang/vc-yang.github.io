I am a Peters Scholar and Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. My research uses mathematical tools to understand complex phenomena in human society. Some topics of my work include crimes in cities and the polarization of political parties. My approach is to build mechanistic models from first principles and to confront them with real-world data. I work closely with social scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I was the founding president of [NuTango](http://nutango.wix.com/nutango), Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I was also the 2016-17 president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Northwestern Chapter.

### Media 
* I gave a talk at the [Seven Minutes of Science Symposium](http://rsg.northwestern.edu/w2017.html) about urban scaling laws and the "reasoning from first principles" approach. [[Talk Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs5ewFzNSYI)
* Northwestern News Network featured my research on urban scaling laws. [[Interview Video]](https://youtu.be/eIiNyI5sWuk?t=18m49s)
* Northwestern University's Data Science Videos featured my work in [[Video 1]](https://youtu.be/9lh6TYon0_I). In [[Video 2]](https://youtu.be/5by2WzQVx9U), I shared my view on two types of data science.


### News 
* Sept 2019: New preprint, [The interpretation of urban scaling analysis in time ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459540), appears on SSRN. We develop a theoretical framework to unify cross-sectional and temporal approaches in urban scaling. 
* Sept 2019: New paper, [Modeling the origin of urban-output scaling  laws](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032306) , appears in *Physical Review E*, explaining why different crimes scale differently with city size, and what these differences tell us about the origin of urban scaling laws 
* July 2019: New paper, [Do two parties represent the US? Clustering analysis of US public ideology](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01651.pdf?ver=2019-07-01-152228-507), appears in *SIAM Undergraduate Research Online*. The paper is lead by my undergraduate mentee, Louisa Lee, and answers if adding more political parties in the US would help represent the public's ideology better. 
* July 2019: Lecture in the SFI Complexity Summer School, about applications of simple dynamical systems models in social problems 
* May 2018: Organize the inaugural [NICO research jam](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/news-events/events/?eid=533417) at Northwestern University
* April 2018: Won the Grand Prize in interactive data visualization at Northwestern University's Computational Research Day, for [*Visualizing the US Congress*](http://www.vcyang.com/vis_congress/)
* May 2017: Won the Red Sock Award for Best Poster Presentation for my model of political polarization at SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems, Snowbird, UT
* April 2017: Organize the Chicago Area SIAM Student Conference. See conference photos [here](https://goo.gl/photos/qsbvGHyJ8QANQHfCA)
