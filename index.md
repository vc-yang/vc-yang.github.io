I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. I strive to uncover the simplicity behind complex issues of human society. Some topics of my work include crime in cities and dynamics of political elections. The methods I use are often a combination of complex systems modeling with differential equations, probability theory, numerical simulations, and learning from data. Prior to joining Northwestern, I worked on mathematical models applied to heat transfer and microwave chemistry.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, photography, and Aikido. I was the founding president of [NuTango](http://nutango.wix.com/nutango), Northwestern University's Argentine Tango Club. I was also the 2016-17 president of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Northwestern Chapter.
