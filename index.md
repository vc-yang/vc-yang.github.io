I am an Assistant Professor in System Dynamics at MIT's Sloan School of Management. My work uses quantitative behavioral models, assisted by the analysis of data, to study collective human behavior on a broad range of organization levels, from teams to cities. Recent research applications include collective decision-making, political polarization, scaling laws in cities, and bureaucracy in organizations. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University and was a fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
